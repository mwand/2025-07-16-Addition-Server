The react frontend works a little:
- frontend/src/main.tsx is the main switch to the React app.
- when <App/> is commented out, it gives a nice looking page
- when <App> points to TwoCountingButtons, it works fine, but the display is put in a narrow column
- when <App> points to ToDoApp.tsx, it does not work, depending on which of the three components are included.
- I get complaints
